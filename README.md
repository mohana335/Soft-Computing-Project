# Detection of Depressive Texts on Social Media Using Deep Learning
Our main goal is to detect signs of depression in social media posts by users, for which we will be taking the help of Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
techniques and Deep Learning approaches to train data collected from the social media, e.g. twitter. This project aims to maximize the utilization of all 
the available linguistic features present in the tweets and makes use of proper cleaning and pre-processing techniques for more accurate identification of 
depressive traits among users.

•Dataset:
The Dataset was sourced from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140

•Preprocessing:
Text case change, Hyperlink Removal, Digits Removal, Spelling Checking, Lemmatization, Removal of Stop words.

•Feature Generation:
Tokenization, Sentiment Extraction, Word2Vec.

•Model Training:
LSTM, CNN-LSTM.
